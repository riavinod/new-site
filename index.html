<h2>
<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>About me</h2>

<p>I'm currently a 2nd Year PhD student at Brown University being supervised by <a href="http://www.lorincrawford.com">Lorin Crawford</a>. I work on protein-design problems and learning data-efficient representations from multimodal distributions.</p>

<!-- <p>I have a <a href="/posts">blog</a> where I write about topics of interest to me: as of the time I write this, there are posts about <a href="https://danielfilan.com/2022/03/10/prob_smart_londoner_dies_of_russian_nuke.html">forecasting</a>, <a href="https://danielfilan.com/2022/02/11/nice_representation_laplacian.html">math</a>, and <a href="https://danielfilan.com/2021/11/21/meta_puzzle.html">puzzles</a>.</p>

<p>I also have a <a href="https://axrp.net">podcast</a> about this field of research. It's called <a href="https://axrp.net">AXRP</a>, which is short for the AI X-risk Research Podcast. You can listen to episodes on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9heHJwb2RjYXN0LmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz">Google podcasts</a>, or by searching "AXRP" in your favourite podcast app. Alteratively, you can read transcripts <a href="https://axrp.net">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm interested in <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruism</a>, how we can use our limited resources to do the most good in the world. I also sometimes <a href="/bets">bet on things</a>, for reasons described by <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/05/the_bettors_oat.html">Bryan Caplan</a> and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/07/kant_on_betting.html">Immanuel Kant</a>.</p>

<p>I did my undergrad at the Australian National University, studying the theory of reinforcement learning, mathematics, and theoretical physics. I did my honours year (similar to a research master's degree lasting one year) under <a href="http://www.hutter1.net/">Marcus Hutter</a>; you can read my thesis "Resource-bounded Complexity-based Priors for Agents" <a href="/pdfs/thesis.pdf">here</a>.</p> -->

<h3>Projects</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Representation Learning for Molecular Property Prediction.</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03386">arxiv</a><br>
With Stephen Casper, Shlomi Hod, Cody Wild, Andrew Critch, and Stuart Russell.<br>
Introduces the task of dividing the neurons of a network into groups such that edges between neurons in the same group have higher weight than edges between neurons in different groups. Implements this using graph clustering, so 'clusterability' refers to the divisibility of networks. Shows that in many conditions, networks trained with pruning and/or dropout are more clusterable than if their weights were randomly permuted. Also introduces a method of regularizing networks for clusterability.</li>

<li><strong>Diffusion Modelling for Sequence-Structure.</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05037">arxiv</a><br>
With Chris Cundy (lead author).<br>
  Presented at GoalsRL 2018, held jointly at ICML, IJCAI, and AAMAS 2018.<br>
Advocates for the use of hierarchical planning models of humans for use in inverse reinforcement learning as more realistic for complex tasks, showing that in one task they perform comparably to state-of-the-art models.</li>
  
<li><strong>Modeling Agents with Probabilistic Programs.</strong> <a href="http://agentmodels.org">website</a><br>
  With Owain Evans (lead author), Andreas Stuhlm&uuml;ller, and John Salvatier.<br>
  Web book.<br>
A web book explaining how to write models of agents in the <a href="http://webppl.org/">webppl</a> probabilistic programming language. Covers topics such as "planning as inference", (PO)MDPs, inverse reinforcement learning, hyperbolic discounting, myopic planning, and multi-agent planning.</li>
