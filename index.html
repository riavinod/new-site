<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h2>

<p>I'm currently a 3rd Year PhD student at Brown University, advised by <a href="http://www.lorincrawford.com">Lorin Crawford</a>. I work on biologically and physically inspired generative models, with a focus on learning meaningful, data-efficient representations for protein-design problems. This summer (2023), I'm a Machine Learning intern at <a href="https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design">Prescient Design</a>, where I'm developing principled score matching methods for biological manifolds, applied to sequence design. </p>

<p>Before that, I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley and graduated in 2021. </p>

<p>I've spent summers at IBM Research, Salesforce and Optum, working on different research and data engineering problems. </p>

<p>As I learn more about math and proteins, I'm trying to make notes and collect useful links. You can find notes <a href="https://riavinod.github.io/2018/08/31/bottle_caps_arent_optimisers.html">here</a> and interesting reads <a href="https://riavinod.github.io/2022/03/10/prob_smart_londoner_dies_of_russian_nuke.html">here</a>. Some of the workflows that I've created as I've needed them can be found on my <a href="https://www.github.com/riavinod">github.</a></p>

<p>I also spend time co-organizing a <a href="https://www.ml4proteinengineering.com">Machine Learning x Proteins seminar series</a> and co-run after-school computational science workshops at Providence public schools with some of my wonderful peers.</p>

<p>As a new graduate student, I thought <a href="https://riavinod.github.io/2018/07/10/mechanistic_transparency.html">these resources</a> were super useful (some Boston-area specific ones too!).</p>


<!-- <p>I have a <a href="/posts">blog</a> where I write about topics of interest to me: as of the time I write this, there are posts about <a href="https://danielfilan.com/2022/03/10/prob_smart_londoner_dies_of_russian_nuke.html">forecasting</a>, <a href="https://danielfilan.com/2022/02/11/nice_representation_laplacian.html">math</a>, and <a href="https://danielfilan.com/2021/11/21/meta_puzzle.html">puzzles</a>.</p>

<p>I also have a <a href="https://axrp.net">podcast</a> about this field of research. It's called <a href="https://axrp.net">AXRP</a>, which is short for the AI X-risk Research Podcast. You can listen to episodes on <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9heHJwb2RjYXN0LmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz">Google podcasts</a>, or by searching "AXRP" in your favourite podcast app. Alteratively, you can read transcripts <a href="https://axrp.net">here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm interested in <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruism</a>, how we can use our limited resources to do the most good in the world. I also sometimes <a href="/bets">bet on things</a>, for reasons described by <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/05/the_bettors_oat.html">Bryan Caplan</a> and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/07/kant_on_betting.html">Immanuel Kant</a>.</p>

<p>I did my undergrad at the Australian National University, studying the theory of reinforcement learning, mathematics, and theoretical physics. I did my honours year (similar to a research master's degree lasting one year) under <a href="http://www.hutter1.net/">Marcus Hutter</a>; you can read my thesis "Resource-bounded Complexity-based Priors for Agents" <a href="/pdfs/thesis.pdf">here</a>.</p> -->
